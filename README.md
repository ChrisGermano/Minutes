# Minutes

An award-winning story-based point-and-click whodunit (holy hyphens Batman!)

Minutes to Midnight has the player assume the role of a president in an unnamed first-world country. Following an unknown explosion, the player and several randomly-generated NPCs are rushed into an underground bunker, with no incoming or outgoing communication. Using clues found in objects and conversation, the player must decide to initiate a military retaliation, or simply sit and wait. The game doesn't have an explicit win or lose scenario, but instead judges the player on whether their decision was correct and how informed they were before making it.

Minutes to Midnight was featured at several events at [Northeastern University](https://camd.northeastern.edu/blog/2014/04/minutes-midnight/), and won the [RISE Award for Innovation in Computer and Information Sciences](https://www.northeastern.edu/rise/presentations/minutes-midnight-promoting-creation-culpability-critical-thinking/).
